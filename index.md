excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a PhD candidate at Memorial University of Newfoundland, 
under the supervision of Dr. Paul Snelgrove and Dr. Robert 
Gregory. I am a student with the Canadian Healthy Oceans 
Network ([CHONe II](https://chone2.ca)). My research focuses on 
overwinter survival of young-of-the-year Atlantic cod (*Gadus 
morhua*). In addition to my dissertation, I spend time teaching 
coding and data science skills to researchers as a 
[Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) instructor, and help run 
a coding group 
([RBar])(https://daniellequinn.github.io/RBarMUN/) at Memorial 
University of Newfoundland.

My scientific career started when I was a student at Bates 
Colllege, in Lewiston, Maine, where I conducted research on the 
feeding ecology of wrymouth (*Cryptacanthodes maculatus*). 
After Bates College, I spent time teaching high school Biology 
as a teaching fellow at the Noble and Greenough School, in 
Dedham, Massachusettes. Following my year of teaching, I spent 
time at the Cape Eleuthera Institute, in Eleuthera, The 
Bahamas as a research intern with the Flats ecology research 
team. 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Juvenile fish ecology
- Population dynamics
- R statistics
- Coding education
