excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a PhD candidate at Memorial University of Newfoundland, 
under the supervision of Dr. Paul Snelgrove and Dr. Robert 
Gregory. I am a student with the Canadian Healthy Oceans 
Network ([CHONe II](https://chone2.ca)). My research focuses on 
overwinter survival of young-of-the-year Atlantic cod (*Gadus 
morhua*). In addition to my dissertation, I spend time teaching 
coding and data science skills to researchers as a 
[Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) instructor, and help run 
a coding group 
([RBar](https://daniellequinn.github.io/RBarMUN/) at Memorial 
University of Newfoundland.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Overwinter Survival of Atlantic cod
- Feeding Ecology of Wrymouth (*Cryptacanthodes maculatus*)
- Beta Regression in R
- Coding education
