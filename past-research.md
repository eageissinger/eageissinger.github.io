### Feeding Preference and Trophic Position of the Wrymouth (*Cryptacanthodes maculatus*), a burrowing predatory fish

Wrymouth are benthic, eel-like fish that can be found in intertidal and subtidal mudflats and also been found in deep sea. In 
the intertidal and subtidal zones, they are known to create a system of tunnes in the sediment. It is believed that they emerge 
from their burrows to feed. Little research has been done on wrymouth until Beal et al. (2016). To follow up on diet research, 
I conducted a study on diet and trophic position of wrymouth as a undergraduate thesis project.

In the spring and summer of 2013, we evaluated the feeding preference and trophic position of wrymouth in two intertidal 
mudflats in Downeast Maine. Wrymouth diet was analyzed using gut content analyses and stable carbon- and nitrogen-isotopes. 
Further analysis to determine prey preference was conducted using Bayesian Mixing Models. Results showed that wrymouth are 
generalist predators. This project was in conjuction with Beal et al.'s (2016) study that looked at gut contents in the same 
area, and confirms what they found. Funding support for this research was provided by Bates College, 
in Lewiston, Main. Manuscript is in prep.
