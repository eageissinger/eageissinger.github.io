#### Background  
The juvenile stage encompasses an important, but poorly 
understood, life history stage in fishes. Survival rate 
from year to year within a population represents a 
critical knowledge gap. Overwinter survival may be 
critical in structuring population abundance. Atlantic cod 
(*Gadus morhua*) are a good model species for age-0 
overwinter survival, given their large size-distribution 
in their first year and overwintering in sub-zero waters. 
Many factors affect survival of juvenile fish, some 
density-dependent, such as habitat, predator density, and 
food availability, and some density-independent, such as 
temperature, size, and growth. We still know little about 
the effects of habitat, predation, food, temperature, and 
growth on overwinter survival of age-0 fish. The purpose 
of my study is to therefor eexamine the variables that 
influence overwinter survival in young-of-year marine fish 
in sub-arctic waters. I use field-based research, 
laboratory research, and long-term monitoring data to 
examine the impacts of various abiotic and biotic factors 
on survival in Atlantic cod during their first winter.

#### Effect of food availability and size on overwinter growth and condition of juvenile Atlantic cod in subarctic coastal Newfoundland  

The purpose of this study is to determine the role size and food availability have on overwinter 
growth, condition, and survival. Feeding trials with age-0 Atlantic cod were conducted at the Ocean 
Sciences Centre, Memorial University of Newfoundland. Cod were divided into two size groups under 
four different feeding rations (0.0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% body weight). Trials were run from January 1, 
2017 to April 24, 2017 in ambient water temperaturs (ranging from 0 to 1.3 degrees Celcius). 
Standard length and weight were monitored monthly, and Fulton's K and hepatosomatic index were used 
to assess condition.

#### Overwinter survival and movement of juvenile Atlantic cod in Newman Sound, NL  

Capture mark recapture (CMR) studies are often difficult to conduct in marine systems due to 
emmigration and spatial extent. Our goal of this study was to determine if juvenile Atlantic cod 
disperse throughout a coastal fjord post-winter. In this study, we marked age-0 Atlantic cod in 
October, 2016 with fluorescent markers in a cove with a discrete eelgrass bed. Cod were released 
back into Newman Sound immediatly after 
each marking period in October. Following winter, we returned to Newman Sound to recapture the 2016 
cohort in the end of May 2017. We sampled in the initial marking site, along with two neighboring 
sites. One was 1.7 km across the sound, while the other was ~1.0 km east along the shore. Otoliths 
of all captured fish were analyzed for fluorescent marks. A total of 33 marks were found out of 226 
marks in the population. Majority of those marks were found at the intial marking site, showing that 
cod are site-dependent.

#### Impact of winter duration on survivorship using pre- and post-winter condition  

Sampling in sub-arctic coastal systems is often limited to the periods surrounding winter, but we 
often cannot monitor coastal areas during the winter months due to ice cover and overwinter movement 
patterns. In this study, our goal is to characterize size-structured survival of juvenile Atlantic 
cod in relation to condition and winter duration. Juvenile Atlantic cod settle in mutliple pulses 
throughout the summer and fall, resulting in a broad size-frequency distribution. The first 
objective of this study was to classify the pulse structure of age-0 and age-1 Atlantic cod using 
mixture distribution models [mixdist] in R. Once pulses have been classified and linked between 
age-0 and age-1, we will determine the survival rates by pulse in relation to pre- and post-winter 
condition, and winter duration.
